High-Level Documentation

Overview
This project comprises the following key files:

index.html: The main HTML file, serving as the entry point and layout for the web page.
css/theme.css: The main stylesheet, generated by a design panel, which defines the appearance (e.g., colors, typography, spacing, components, layout) of the web page.

Structure & Functionality

1. index.html
- Serves as the primary structure of the web application or website.
- Organizes the content and elements to be displayed to users.
- References the external stylesheet (css/theme.css) for presentation and theme.
- Does not utilize any design system framework; it is based on plain HTML.

2. css/theme.css
- This file contains the styles applied to the HTML elements.
- Generated automatically (read-only) via a design panel, ensuring design consistency.
- Encapsulates all visual/thematic settings, potentially including colors, fonts, spacing, responsive rules, and component styles.

Usage Notes
- All content, structure, and logic reside within the index.html file.
- All visual presentation details are handled by css/theme.css.
- As the stylesheet is locked and auto-generated, direct modifications should be conducted through the design panel rather than editing the CSS file directly.

Design Patterns & Tools
- Follows a clear separation of concerns: structure/markup (HTML) vs. appearance/theme (CSS).
- Uses plain HTML for markup, without reliance on external frameworks or libraries.

Customization & Maintenance
- Changes to design and appearance should be made via the design panel, not by editing css/theme.css.
- Content and structure updates are managed directly in index.html.

Intended Audience
- Developers and designers working on the project, especially those utilizing visual design tools for theme management.
- End-users interact solely with the rendered content in their browsers; the implementation details are abstracted away.

Summary
This project leverages a clean and maintainable workflow by separating content (index.html) from design (auto-generated theme.css). All styling changes should use the provided design tools, ensuring consistency and manageability across the project.
